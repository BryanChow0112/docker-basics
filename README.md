# Docker Basics

This repository documents **my learning journey into Docker**, a powerful platform for containerization. I created this repository while following a structured Docker Fundamentals course by Adrian Cantrill to gain a solid understanding of Docker concepts and practical applications.

## Key Learnings

*   **Containerization:** Understood containers and their efficiency/portability advantages over VMs.
  
*   **Docker Architecture:** Explored Docker Engine, Client, Docker Hub components and their interaction.
  
*   **Docker Images & Containers:** Learned how images are constructed in layers and how containers are lightweight, runnable instances of these images, leading to efficient resource utilization.
  
*   **Docker Image Management:** Practiced pulling, running and managing images from Docker Hub.
  
*   **Dockerfiles for Custom Images:** Learned to write Dockerfiles to automate image creation and define reproducible environments.
  
*   **Docker Storage:** Explored writable layers, bind mounts, volumes for data persistence and sharing.
  
*   **Docker Networking:** Learned network modes and port exposure for container connectivity and accessibility.
  
*   **Environment Variables:** Used environment variables for flexible container configuration.
  
*   **Docker Compose:** Introduced to Docker Compose for managing multi-container applications.
  
*   **Docker Registries (Docker Hub):** Learned about Docker Hub and publishing images for sharing.
